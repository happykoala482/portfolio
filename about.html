          <h2>Spotify</h2>
          <p class="after-paragraph-spacing">From June to September of 2022 I was Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Spotify, and I'll be returning full time in July of 2023. While at the company, I accomplished the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Productionized prototype that automatically detects subgroups with outlier performance in A/B tests</li>
            <li>Beta tested Ray as a means of adding distributing compute capabilities to ML projects</li>
            <li>I achieved a 20x increase in the number of user samples capable of being processed without meaningfully increasing compute time</li>
            <li>Added backend support for feature importance weights to existing model-feature objects</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Promoted.ai</h2>
          <p class="after-paragraph-spacing">From June to September of 2021 I was Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Promoted.ai. While at the company, I accomplished the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Promoted.ai specializes in discovery and performance ads for marketplaces </li>
            <li>Productionized an open-source Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model</li>
            <li>Implemented a custom Two-Tower model based on a research paper from eBay</li>
            <li>Item and user embeddings generated from the Two-Tower model helped to achieve a 7% improvement in checkouts at the company's first customer, Hipcamp</li>
